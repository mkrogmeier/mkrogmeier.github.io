		<h1>So the story goes...</h1>
		<p>In September 2013, I moved to Brooklyn, specifically the Boerum Hill neighborhood. Choosing which neighborhood to live to call home can be a difficult decision and NYC can be especially challenging. </p>

		<p>On the weekends, my one of favorite ways to explore the NYC is on foot NYC and I love coffee.  I wanted to explore the neighborhoods by foot and would find a coffee shop (usually via FourSquare or Yelp) and after a walk want to work a little. 
		</p>

		<p>At times, I got frustrated because the popular spots usually have a no laptop policies on the weekend, which is understandable, but usually not listed on Foursquare or the shop&#39;s website. So this site was born out that frustration. It&#39;s also my final (work&#45;in&#45;progress) project for my Front&#45;End Web Development (aka FEWD) taught by <a href="#" title="General Assembly" title="General Assembly" >General Assembly.</a> </p>
