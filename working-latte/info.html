		<h1>So the story goes...</h1>
		<p>In September 2013, I moved to Brooklyn, specifically the Boerum Hill neighborhood.</p>

		<p>My favorite way to explore NYC, or any city for that matter, is on foot and I've found that an afternnon in a coffee shop is like a window into the character of the neighborhod. So on weekends, I'd find a coffee shop (usually via FourSquare or Yelp) in a new part of town to give me a starting point or and end destination for my walks.  
		</p>
		<p>And sometimes, I simply wanted a fun place to work and enjoy a latte.</p>

		<p>I quickly became frustrated because popular coffee shops usually have a no laptop policies on the weekends, understandablely, but that info wasn't listed on Foursquare or the shop&#39;s website. So this site was born out that frustration. It&#39;s also my final (work&#45;in&#45;progress) project for my Front&#45;End Web Development (aka FEWD) taught by <a href="#" title="General Assembly" title="General Assembly" >General Assembly.</a> </p>
